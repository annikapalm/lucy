She also had a big smile and giggled as she spat on her hand (or maybe placed something on her hand I can’t remember exactly) as she sticks out her hand for a handshake and grabs my hand. When she spits or slaps something in her hand it was like a weird small marble glowing thing. Imagine a tiny dragonball typa thing. She laughs as she shakes my hand and the ball wasn’t there when I connected hands with her n then I woke up and felt kinda scared? I then turn the lights on for a bit and try to stay in light.",

And I guess I had received news that I was going to die, in a last ditch effort of experiencing something out of the ordinary, I wanted my death to be caused by jumping out in space to a certain star, where death would be inevitable, but I would be looking at something beautiful before I died, and do one thing in control in my life. In the dream I had a boyfriend that offered to go with me in the spaceship to see the star knowing he would die. (idk why but you couldn’t return back to earth after leaving earth). But I didn’t let him (no one I knew irl). What could this dream mean? ",

    "title" : "Really weird, unsettling dream about disappearing old man",
    "text" : "Dimly lit room, something like a basement. In the middle of the room is a table. On the table is something like a wooden sarcophagus or a coffin. There’s no lid, and in it lies an old man. His eyes are closed as if resting. Entirely surrounding the table are men, they are soldiers. They aren’t dressed in military uniforms, and I know not what they’re soldiers for, but they’re soldiers. Each of the soldiers, all of them, have both of their hands on some part of the old man’s body, as though holding him down. They’re holding him all down his arms and legs, and on his torso, it’s a bit crowded. It feels very necessary that they do this, but it is unclear why. The old man is completely unmoving, not resisting or anything at all. After a moment there’s a voice. It is a horrible, deep, booming voice. It’s the voice of the old man, but it is not spoken. The old man’s face is motionless, his eyes still closed, but the voice is heard. It is not spoken, but it is in the minds of all of the soldiers. They all hear this terrible voice. I don’t remember exactly what the voice says, but it is something about a fire. A great, burning fire. The voice ceases, and after a moment the old man’s body suddenly becomes invisible. It’s as though he had disappeared, yet the hands of the soldiers don’t move. They seem to be still holding and leaning on old man’s body, but it’s become completely unseen and invisible. A brief moment later, that invisible body is suddenly gone completely. The soldiers’ hands are holding nothing at all, and their hands abruptly reach the bottom of the sarcophagus, as when something you’re putting pressure on is pulled out from under you. There is a moment of confusion, and then the sound of footsteps. The soldiers can hear the sound of bare feet on the cold, concrete floor. They look to the sound of the footsteps and see no one, nothing at all. There’s another footstep, and another. The footsteps are approaching one of the soldiers. The footsteps stop just before the soldier. The soldier is seemly unaffected, and there are no more footsteps. Gone, whatever it was. Dream ends there. I awoke with tears in my eyes, but not feeling scared, super weird.",
