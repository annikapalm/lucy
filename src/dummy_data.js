She also had a big smile and giggled as she spat on her hand (or maybe placed something on her hand I can’t remember exactly) as she sticks out her hand for a handshake and grabs my hand. When she spits or slaps something in her hand it was like a weird small marble glowing thing. Imagine a tiny dragonball typa thing. She laughs as she shakes my hand and the ball wasn’t there when I connected hands with her n then I woke up and felt kinda scared? I then turn the lights on for a bit and try to stay in light.",

        "text" : "I had a dream where I lived in a futuristic utopia. And I guess I had received news that I was going to die, in a last ditch effort of experiencing something out of the ordinary, I wanted my death to be caused by jumping out in space to a certain star, where death would be inevitable, but I would be looking at something beautiful before I died, and do one thing in control in my life. In the dream I had a boyfriend that offered to go with me in the spaceship to see the star knowing he would die. (idk why but you couldn’t return back to earth after leaving earth). But I didn’t let him (no one I knew irl). What could this dream mean? ",
